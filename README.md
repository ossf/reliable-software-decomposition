# **Reliable Software Decomposition SIG**

The Reliable Software Decomposition SIG is a Special Interest Group at
the the sandbox stage. The SIG reports to the OpenSSF Security Tooling
Working Group.

##
**Motivation**

Disassembly is a foundational step of a wide range of software
maintainance workflows, including debugging, profiling, reverse
engineering, security analysis, dependency analysis, patching, binary
translation, and optimization. Unfortunately, correct disassembly is
undecidable and existing security and maintainance tools must rely on
complex heuristics and manual work by experts. The resulting partial
and/or inaccurate disassembly can lead to missed or erroneous
vulnerability reports, inaccurate software composition analysis, or
incorrect patches or optimizations.

Some of the information required to make disassembly possible without
these complex heuristics is already available in existing toolchain
artifacts, but enabled or used only to varying degrees. For example,
many system profiling tools depend on `.eh_frame` unwinding
metadata. Some other information, like the structure of assembly jump
tables, is simply not available.

The goal of this special interest group is to develop a set of
standard practices (enabled toolchain flags, features, etc.) and/or
extensions to ELF and associated toolchains to enable fully automated,
reliable disassembly of the resulting binaries.

##
**Objective**

Our planned initial deliverables will include a document compiling:
- a list of existing areas where current disassemblers must rely on
  heuristics,
- a list of existing sources of metadata that could address these
  deficiencies if enabled, and
- a list of gaps that could be addressed with additional metadata
  generated by toolchains.

Guided by this deliverable, we then plan to draft a specification for
what information must be included in an ELF object to enable
disassembly, where and how it can be found in an ELF binary, and what
additional data should be added as ELF extensions. We also plan to
develop prototype implementations of the necessary extensions and work
with toolchain communities to incorporate the required features. If we
have developed sufficient community interest at this stage, we will
explore converting the SIG into a OpenSSF project to organize work on
the specification and tooling.

##
**Scope**

These efforts will be scoped to language-independent information about
binary programs; that is, improvements to the ELF standard and related
tools that enable reliable disassembly rather than the more general
problem of decompilation. Initially, our efforts will focus on the
x86_64 Linux platform, but the extensions should be platform agnostic
where practicable.
